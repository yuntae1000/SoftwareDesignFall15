<Tool box machine learning?

1. What is the general trend of the curve?
In general the Accuracy on Test set increases as the Percentage of Data used for training increase. 

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
In my plot at points with x-values 30%, 40% and 60% showed unexpected y-results and seemed to be noiser. I think this is becuase of small number of trials. 

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
from 40 trials the plot got smooth!

4.Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.

As C value increases the plot overfitts and doesn't look like linear plot! This is because as C value increases the regularization decreases which is applying a penalty to increasing the magnitude of parameter value in order to reduce overfitting.
